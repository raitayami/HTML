# HTML

I am currently embarking on the **_FULL STACK ENGINEERING COURSE on Codecademy_**.

I have just finished the **_GITHUB_** section, so i thought id practice my GITHUB skills on the previous units i have covered, rather than the knowledge just sitting on my notes

### What

I will be doing this for all of the major sections in the syllabus

This one is regarding the Fundamentals of HTML, there will be others ones as teh day progresses for units such as
CSS, Responsiveness, Javscript and many more

### Purpose

The reasoning behind this is to better my programming skills consistently and eventually get employed.

That does not mean after emplyoment i stop learning, but rather, this acts as a base, a seed.

I genuinely love programming as it sparks the creativity, innovative side within me.

And lastly, it makes me take actions rather than speaking about it and having nothing to show for it.
